This is one of my first SQL projects. This project was a requirement in freecodecamp.org.
The task was to create celestial bodies like solar systems and moon systems in our galaxy and to assign values to them and perform SQL commands.
The project was done online in a virtual linux machine which was run using ubuntu. Bash scripting was used to connect to the PostgreSQL terminal.
